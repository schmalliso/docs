file: /core/index-single
description: |
  A single field index only includes data from a single field of the
  documents in a collection. MongoDB supports single field indexes on
  fields at the top level of a document *and* on fields in sub-documents.
---

description: |
   A compound index includes more than one field of the documents in a
   collection.
---
file: /core/index-multikey
description: |
   A multikey index is an index on an array field, adding an index key
   for each value in the array.
---
file: /core/index-hashed
description: |
   Hashed indexes maintain entries with hashes of the values of the
   indexed field and are primarily used with sharded clusters to
   support hashed shard keys.
---
file: /core/index-ttl
description: |
   The TTL index is used for TTL collections, which expire data after a
   period of time.
---
file: /core/index-unique
description: |
   A unique index causes MongoDB to reject all documents that contain
   a duplicate value for the indexed field.
---
file: /core/index-sparse
description: |
   A sparse index does not index documents that do not have the indexed
   field.
---
file: /administration/indexes-management
name: "Index Management"
description: |
   Monitor and assess index performance and rebuild indexes as needed.

file: /tutorial/build-indexes-on-replica-sets
description: |
   To build indexes on a replica set, you build the indexes separately
   on the primary and the secondaries, as described here.
---
file: /tutorial/build-indexes-in-the-background
description: |
   Background index construction allows read and write operations to
   continue while building the index, but take longer to complete and
   result in a larger index.
