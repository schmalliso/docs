Add a User
----------

To create a user, specify the user name, password, and :ref:`roles
<roles>`. For users that authenticate using external mechanisms
[#external-auth-mechanisms]_, you do not need to provide the password
when creating users.

When assigning roles, select the roles that have the exact required
:ref:`privileges <privileges>`. If the correct roles does not exist,
you can :ref:`create new roles <create-user-defined-role>`.

.. [#external-auth-mechanisms] See :ref:`security-auth-x509`,
