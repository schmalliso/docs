     This tutorial uses the :method:`db.getUser()` method to retrieve
     user information for a specified user, including the :ref:`roles
     <roles>` and :doc:`actions </reference/privilege-actions>`
     assigned to that user.

   time: 2
   prerequisites:
     To view user information, you must connect to a :binary:`~bin.mongod`
     or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance from the :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell
     and :method:`authenticate as a user <db.auth()>` with appropriate privileges.

   check_your_environment:
     Use the :dbcommand:`connectionStatus` command to verify that you
     are an authenticated user. :dbcommand:`connectionStatus` lists all
     currently-authenticated users.

   procedure:
   
     .. include:: /includes/view-user-roles-and-privileges.rst

   summary:
     If you have successfully completed this procedure, you will have
     viewed the roles assigned for the specified user and then retrieved
     the user's full set of privileges.
