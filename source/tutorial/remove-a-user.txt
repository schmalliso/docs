     This tutorial uses the :method:`db.dropUser()` method to delete
     a user from the specified database.
     
   time: 2
   prerequisites:
   
     To delete a user from your database,you must connect to the
     :binary:`~bin.mongod` or :binary:`~bin.mongos` instance containing
     the database to which the user belongs from the
     :binary:`~bin.mongo` shell and :method:`authenticate as a user
     <db.auth()>` with appropriate privileges.

     .. include:: /includes/access-drop-user.rst

   check_your_environment:
     Use the :dbcommand:`connectionStatus` command to verify that
     you are an authenticated user. :dbcommand:`connectionStatus` lists
     all currently-authenticated users.
     
     To verify that your user possess the required permissions to grant
     or revoke roles on that database, follow the procedure in
     :doc:`/tutorial/view-a-users-roles`.
   
   procedure:

     The following procedure delete the ``reportsUser`` user that was
     created in the ``reporting`` database.
     
     #. Switch to the user's authentication database:

        .. code-block:: sh

           use reporting

     #. Use :method:`db.dropUser()` to delete the user with username
        ``reportsUser``. To ensure that the user changes propagate to a
        majority of the :term:`replica set` or :term:`sharded cluster`
        before the operation returns, specify a :writeconcern:`majority`
        :ref:`write concern` and use the :ref:`wtimeout <wc-wtimeout>`
        to ensure that the write operation does not block infinitely:
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
           db.dropUser( "reportsUser", { w : "majority", wtimeout : 5000 } )
        
        If successful, the operation returns ``true``. If the operation
        returns ``false``, you have not deleted the user and will need
        to try the operation again.
     
   summary:
     If you have successfully completed this procedure, you will have
     removed the user from MongoDB.
