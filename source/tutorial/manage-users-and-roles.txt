Overview
--------

This tutorial provides examples for user and role management under the
MongoDB's authorization model. :doc:`/tutorial/create-users` describes
how to add a new user to MongoDB.


Prerequisites
-------------

.. important::

   If you have :doc:`enabled access control
   </tutorial/enable-authentication>` for your deployment, you must
   authenticate as a user with the required privileges specified in each
   section. A user administrator with the
   :authrole:`userAdminAnyDatabase` role, or :authrole:`userAdmin` role
   in the specific databases, provides the required privileges to perform
   the operations listed in this tutorial. See
   :doc:`/tutorial/enable-authentication` for details on adding user
   administrator as the first user.
