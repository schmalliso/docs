MongoDB Configuration Hardening
-------------------------------

IP Binding
~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-default-bind-ip-change.rst

.. include:: /includes/warning-bind-ip-security-considerations.rst

.. warning::

   Make sure that your :binary:`~bin.mongod` and :binary:`~bin.mongos`
   instances are only accessible on trusted networks. If your system
   has more than one network interface, bind MongoDB programs to the
   private or internal network interface.

For more information, see :doc:`/core/security-mongodb-configuration`.

HTTP Status Interface and REST API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: /includes/fact-deprecated-http-interface.rst

Network Hardening
-----------------

To restrict exposure to MongoDB, configure firewalls to control access to
MongoDB systems. Use of VPNs can also provide a secure tunnel.

For more information, see :doc:`/core/security-network`.
